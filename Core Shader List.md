# Non-Rendertype
There are several shaders which are not prefixed with `rendertype_`. These seem to be for more general targets, such as the sky or all particles.  

### blit_screen  
Blit copies one buffer to another, however this cannot be overridden in a resource pack.

[Back to Top](#contents)

---

### particle  
Weather (snow and rain) and all particles. The alpha value specified in the shader will override the particleâ€™s inbuilt transparency e.g. in the sneeze particle. Others, like the splash particle, don't seem to allow this. More testing needed.

[Back to Top](#contents)

---

### position
The colour of the sky. Also affects text highlighting. 

[Back to Top](#contents)

---

### position_color
Handles a few different things:
* The black transparent background on UI elements such as the chat field, the pause menu, and the scoreboard sidebar,
* The Mojang loading background,
* Highlighting item slots,
* The background of tooltips,
* The transparent lower hemisphere overlay on the sky approximately between times 11315 to 14150 (sunset) and 21830 to 24670 (sunrise),
* The black bars on the sides when scoped in with a spyglass,
* The f3+G chunk border displays.

For UI elements, Position is the screen size divided by the GUI scale. E.g. 1920x1080 with GUI scale 3 means Position for x will be [0,640] and for y [0,360].

---

### position_tex
Handles a few different things:
* The Sun and Moon,
* The worldborder, 
* Most GUI textures (like the hotbar, buttons), 
* Overlays (pumpkin blur, powder snow, the vignette),
* The crosshair.
* The mojang logo in loading screens.

# Rendertype
These are shaders which are targeted towards a specific element of the display.
**For each shader name here, assume that it is prefixed with `rendertype_`.**

## Blocks
When dealing with block shaders which have something to do with `translucent`, `cutout` or `cutout_mipped`, here is a [useful list](List%20of%20Blocks%20Affected.md) for all blocks of those specific types.

[Back to Top](#contents)


### solid
All solid blocks, lava, and when in fast mode, leaves. Also affects non-translucent falling blocks.

### entity_translucent
Translucent entities and parts of entities: 
* Slimes,
* Players (except for the lower layer of the arm in first person),
* Player heads, 
* Markings on horses, 
* Shulker bullets, 
* Elder guardian particle effect. 

Sampler1 contains the red color that is overlayed on entities when they take damage.

[Back to Top](#contents)

---

### entity_solid
Handles a few different things: 
* The base (not flag) of banners,
* Shulker heads, 
* Books on lecterns/enchantment tables, 
* Shields, 
* Beds, 
* The bell part of bells, 
* Capes, 
* Shells of conduits, 
* Paintings, 
* Tridents, 
* The ears on the Deadmau5 skin,
* The bottom skin layer of the first-person hand,
* The conduit item in the inventory.

With item frames, the item frame entity itself is part of the shader, however, items on it are not. Only the filled-in parts of maps placed on an item frame are part of the shader.

### entity_translucent_cull
Flat texture items and transparent blocks held by entities or on head, in the inventory, and as entities. If Fabulous graphics is off, this shader also affects translucent items like stained glass and their panes, however if it is on, you should check [item_entity_translucent_cull](#item_entity_translucent_cull).

---

### armor_entity_glint
The glint on enchanted armour. Slight transparency is inbuilt and unchangeable.

<img src="https://github.com/McTsts/shaders/blob/main/images/rendertype_armor_entity_glint.png" width=300>

[Back to Top](#contents)

---

### glint
The glint on (stained) glass and (stained) glass panes, while rendered in the world. That means as dropped item, in an item frame, when held (except for when you're holding it yourself and are in first person view (default)). Does *not* render glass in inventory or when held in first person view, in those cases it's rendered by `glint_direct`. 

[Back to Top](#contents)

---

### glint_direct
The enchant glint in most situations. Enchanted worn armor is rendered by `armor_entity_glint` and glass type blocks are rendered by `glint` when in world instead.

[Back to Top](#contents)

---

### glint_translucent
The enchant glint in translucent blocks (like stained glass) in world when graphics setting is `Fabolous!`.

### water_mask
Hides the water in a boat. Changing the color does not seem to have an effect, but changing the position does. Pictured left is moving the mask down by 64, pictured right is moving it to the right by 2.

## UI
These are shaders which affect some part of the UI. This is currently just text, as most UI elements are rendered by [Non-Rendertype](#non-rendertype) shaders.

### text
All parts of text, including the shadow. This encompasses all text rendered including: F3 Menu, Menu button text, Entity names, Item names, descriptions & amounts in the inventory and the Chat etc. It also does the explored parts of maps

#### Isolating Elements
Isolating certain texts. Different types of text can be isolated using their Position.z. Texts without a shadow are located at x, texts with a shadow are located at x + 0.03 with their shadow being at x. (e.g. at 0.0 and 0.03).

A basic list of where which text is located: (Not Complete!)
* -200: Advancement menu text
* 0: /title text, bossbar name, world/server selection name/description text, resourcepack selection "Available" and "Selected" text.
* 0.03: Menu (pause/options) text and inventory Potion effect text
* 100: Chat display, Recipe book search text
* 200: Item count in hotbar
* 300: Item count in inventory
* 400: Item count while dragging item, tooltip texts, compact potion info
* 0 to 104: Maps (not actually text)

Since maps share the z value with the chat display and a part of the hotbar item count, you can test for Sampler0 having a size of 128 pixels in both directions to test for the face being a map.

### text_see_through

## Other
These are shaders that render things that aren't clearly either a block, an entity or a ui element.

### lines
Handles a few different things:
* The outline when hovering over a block,
* The debug crosshair,
* The f3+B hitbox displays,
* Previews in the structure block.

# Unknown

These are shaders that exist in the files that we do not currently know the purpose of. More testing is needed for these.

### block
